The Robockets have a large programming team that solves all sorts of programming problems with a wide variety of tools. You don't need to know how to program coming in. If you're willing to learn, we're willing to teach!

The programming language we use to program the robot is [Java](https://java.com/en/). Here's a sample of what Java code looks like:

{% highlight java %}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("I love robots!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a very small program that will output the text "I love robots!" to the screen. You can run it for yourself [here](https://repl.it/BzuN) without installing anything onto your computer, and you can even make your own changes!

The other programming language we like to use is [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python programs tend to be much more consise than their Java equivalents. For example, the program above could be written in Python as:

{% highlight python %}
print("I love robots!")
{% endhighlight %}

You can fiddle with this code for yourself on the [same website as before](https://repl.it/Bzu6).

We typically use Python for smaller projects, like our [old scouting platform](https://github.com/Team4761/Scattergun) or our [vision tracking system](https://github.com/Team4761/2016-Vision/tree/master/python).

### What would I do as a programmer?

 * **Program the robot and see your code run in competitions.** Those PID loops aren't going to tune themselves.
 * **Design and build websites.** Like our scouting platform, but this year it will actually be good.
 * **Make cool stuff on embedded systems.** We do most of our embedded stuff on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Examples of this include our vision tracking systems and our [Modular Autonomous chooser](https://github.com/Team4761/Modular-Autonomous) for the 2016 game.

### Where can I learn before joining?
We recommend [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for getting started with learning about the technologies we use. They have free courses for [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java), [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python), and [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) (a tool we use for managing code).

FRC (the people who run the robot competition) also provide [online documentation for their software that we use](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s), if you want to get a preview of the robot programming you'll be doing.

In the end though, the best way to learn to program is to find a project you're excited about and dive right in. Like video games? Look into making a mod or plugin for your favorite game! More interested in cooking? Write your own timer app! Want a blog? Make your own from scratch! The possibilities are endless.
